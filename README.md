## 🏃‍♂️ Development

## 🏗️ Building & Deployment

### Desktop App (Windows)
To create the installer (MSI/EXE):
```bash
npm run dist
```
*The installer files will be generated in the `dist` or `release` folder.*

### Web App (PWA) on GitHub Pages
To deploy the live version to `https://bpmn.veilands.com`:
```bash
npm run deploy
```
*   **Note:** This command automatically handles building the `dist` folder, adding the `.nojekyll` file (for GitHub compatibility), and pushing to the `gh-pages` branch.
*   **Important:** Remember to push your source code changes to `main` separately (`git push origin main`).

## ❓ FAQ

**Why isn't the "Export PNG" button working?**
Ensure you have a valid diagram loaded. The button is disabled if the canvas is empty.

**Why does the PWA Install prompt look for `manifest.webmanifest`?**
This file is auto-generated by Vite during the build process based on `vite.config.js`. You do not need to edit it manually.

**How do I change the App Icon?**
Replace `public/icon.png` (and update references in `vite.config.js` if the name changes).
